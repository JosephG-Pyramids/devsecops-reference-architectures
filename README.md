# DevSecOps Reference Architectures

This is a collection of DevSecOps reference architectures. I was tired of crawling through low resolution slideshares and email-grabbing web forms, therefore I started this repo to share reference architectures - for free - for everyone.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute via pull requests or issues. If you find slides in a higher quality, please let me know!

Please provide the following data for new architectures:
* Name of the source of the architecture
* Image of the reference architecture
* Year when the architecture was designed
* Optional: Link to the source for more information
* Optional: Summary of the architecture. What makes it special? Where does it differentiate? What is the problem it solves?
* Optional: Software stack. That makes it easier to search for architectures that use a specific tool.

## Architectures
